### Introduction
I am a coding guru and hearthstone player. We have a good community with a lot of creative custom cards. Since the new battlepass, I think we deserve to play a better collectible card game. With fair pack opening mechanism, better dust value or even trade cards.

### Implementation
Unity 2019.4
Might switch to ECS when it is officially released.

### Asset specification
